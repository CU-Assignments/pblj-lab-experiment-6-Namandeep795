To implement a Java program that sorts a list of Employee objects (based on name, age, and salary) using lambda expressions and stream operations to demonstrate efficient data processing.
SOLUTION:
import java.util.*;

class Employee {
    String name;
    int age;
    double salary;

    Employee(String name, int age, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + " - Age: " + age + ", Salary: " + salary;
    }
}

public class EmployeeSort {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(
            new Employee("Ayush", 20, 90000),
            new Employee("Vinay", 22, 100000),
            new Employee("Prakul", 23, 70000)
        );

        employees.sort(Comparator.comparing(emp -> emp.name));
        System.out.println("Sorted by Name: " + employees);

        employees.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(emp -> emp.age));
        System.out.println("Sorted by Age: " + employees);

        employees.sort(Comparator.comparingDouble(emp -> emp.salary));
        System.out.println("Sorted by Salary: " + employees);
    }
}

Step 1: Create the Employee Class
-Define an Employee class with the following attributes:
  name (String)
  age (int)
  salary (double)
-Create a constructor to initialize these values.
-Implement a display() method to print employee details.
  
Step 2: Create the Main Class
-Initialize an ArrayList<Employee> and add sample employee data.
-Use lambda expressions to sort the list:
  Sort by Name (Alphabetical order)
  Sort by Age (Ascending order)
  Sort by Salary (Descending order)
  
Step 3: Display the Sorted List
Use forEach() with a method reference to print the sorted employees.


Test Cases
Test Case         	Input Data                                                      	                    Expected Output
Case 1:       Sorting by Name	Alice (30, 50000), Bob (25, 60000), Charlie (35, 55000)	                    Alice, Bob, Charlie (sorted alphabetically)
Case 2:       Sorting by Age	Alice (30, 50000), Bob (25, 60000), Charlie (35, 55000)	                    Bob, Alice, Charlie (sorted by age in ascending order)
Case 3:       Sorting by Salary	Alice (30, 50000), Bob (25, 60000), Charlie (35, 55000)              	    Bob, Charlie, Alice (sorted by salary in descending order)
Case 4:       Edge Case - Same Name, Different Age	Alex (28, 45000), Alex (32, 47000), Alex (25, 46000)	Sorted by age (25 → 28 → 32)
Case 5:       Edge Case - Same Salary	David (29, 50000), Eve (31, 50000), Frank (27, 50000)	              Sorted by name if salary is the same
